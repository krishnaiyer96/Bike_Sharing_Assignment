# Project Name - Bike Sharing System Multiple Linear Regression
> In this project I have developed a Linear Model for Boombikes company. Its a bike sharing company. From the model, buisness can understand the factors which will effect the demand for bike sharing and how the bike sharing demand will vary depending upon other independent factors like temperature, weather, season, windspeed etc.
So, Using this Linear model company can predit and according work to over come the lossess to the buisness.

## General Information
- I have developed a Multiple Linear Regression model for predicting the demand for the bike sharing business company by varying other independent factors. This model can be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- From this model Buisness can predit how the bike sharing demand will vary depending on the factors like Temperature, Weather, Windspeed, season etc. By this buisness the avoid the unexpected lossess .
- The data set being used has the information of how the number of people sharing the bike vary with changing parameters. 




## Conclusions
- Following are the comclusions from the Model 
- Temperature (temp) - A coefficient value of ‘0.5644’ indicated that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.5644 units. 
-  Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3) - A coefficient value of ‘-0.3071’ indicated that, w.r.t Weathersit1, a unit increase in Weathersit3 variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.3071 units. 
-  Year (yr) - A coefficient value of ‘0.2303’ indicated that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.2303 units. So, it's suggested to consider these variables utmost importance while planning, to achive maximum Booking The next best features that can also be considered are

- season_4: - A coefficient value of ‘0.1292’ indicated that w.r.t season_1, a unit increase in season_4 variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.1292 units. windspeed: - A coefficient value of ‘-0.1542’ indicated that, a unit increase in windspeed variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.1542 units.
